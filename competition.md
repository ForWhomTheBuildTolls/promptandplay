# Competition Plan: AI Prompt & Play üïπÔ∏è

## Overview
Recreate a classic game of your choice with a **unique twist**, using only AI-generated code.

---

## The Challenge
**Game:** Recreate a classic arcade game of your choice.  
**Examples:** Pong, Snake, Breakout, Tetris, Pac-Man, Space Invaders.  

**Advice:** A polished, simple game with a clever twist will score higher than a complex but buggy one.  

**Tech Stack:** Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (HTML5).  
- No external libraries unless the AI explicitly generates them.  

**The Twist:** Add a unique feature or mechanic that changes **core gameplay**, not just visuals.  

**Time Limit:** 2 hours of coding time.  

**Core Constraint:** All functional code must be generated by an AI. You are the **director**, not the typist.

## Core Rules & Boundaries

### AI is the Coder
- You **cannot** write your own HTML, CSS, or JavaScript logic from scratch.
- Your role: prompt, orchestrate AI output, manage files, debug.

### Approved Tools
- Any in-house AI tool (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT Enterprise, GitHub Copilot).

### Permitted Actions
- Create `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`.  
- Copy/paste AI-generated code.  
- Prompt AI for bug fixes, refactors, explanations.  

### Forbidden Actions
- Writing your own game loops, core functions, or complex CSS.  
- Manually coding major fixes or features. (Minor typo fixes are fine.)

## Submission
At **12:00 PM**, submit a `.zip` file containing:
1. All project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)  
2. A `prompts.md` log of the key prompts used

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **1. Core Recreation** | Does the game function as a faithful recreation?                                              | 1 = Not functional <br> 5 = Flawless |

| **3. Technical Execution** | Smoothness, polish, bug level (reflecting skill in prompting/debugging).                   | 1 = Very buggy <br> 5 = Seamless |
| **4. Prompt Craft**     | Were prompts clear, concise, and effective in directing the AI?                              | 1 = Vague <br> 5 = Masterful |
| **Total Score**         | Out of 20                                                                                   |             |

**Note on Scoring:** Consider **game complexity** (e.g., Pac-Man harder than Pong). Judge execution relative to ambition.

## Example Twists for Inspiration
